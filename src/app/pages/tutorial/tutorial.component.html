<h1>Generative Adversial Network Introduction</h1>

<h2>Basic concept</h2>

<p>Generative adversial networks aren't as complicated as they sound. Essentially, a GAN is a competition between a discriminator and a generator. A discriminator is a classic image classifier that tries to predict which image given is real versus generated. The generator generates images that fit within the data distribution (meaning, a generator will try and generate all possible cat images if trained on cat photos - even ones not in the dataset!). Ian Goodfellow, the man who invented this approach, likens the generator and discriminator to a counterfeiter and a policeman respectively. The counterfeiter (generator) seeks to make dollar bills as realistic as possible, whereas the policeman tries to distinguish between real and fake currency. If the counterfeiter succeeds, the policeman or discriminator will be unable to tell the difference. This is the goal of most GAN projects - to eventually fool the discriminator with the generator.</p>
